        <p><b>Maroon 5</b> is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. It currently
            consists of
            lead vocalist Adam Levine, lead guitarist James Valentine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse
            Carmichael,
            bassist Mickey Madden, drummer Matt Flynn, and keyboardist PJ Morton. Before the current group was
            established,
            the original four members, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Levine'>Adam Levine</a> (lead
            vocals, lead guitar), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Carmichael'>Jesse Carmichael</a>
            (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Madden'>Mickey Madden</a>
            (bass guitar) and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dusick'>Ryan Dusick</a> (drums), formed a
            band known as <b>Kara's Flowers</b> in 1994, while they were still in high school. The band, which
            self-released
            an album called <i>We Like Digging?</i>, then signed to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprise_Records'
            >Reprise Records</a> and released the album
            <i>The Fourth World</i> in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the
            record
            label and the members attended college.</p>
        <h3>Image</h3>
        <p>In 2001, the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under
            the
            name Maroon 5. At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main
            instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records,
            and
            released their debut album, <i>Songs About Jane</i>, in June 2002. The album's lead single, "Harder to
            Breathe",
            received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. In
            2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed "the sleeper hit of the millennium". The band won the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award'>Grammy Award</a> for Best New Artist in 2005.
            For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of <i>Songs About Jane</i> and
            produced
            two live recordings: 2004's <i>1.22.03.Acoustic</i> and 2005's <i>Live&#160;&#8211; Friday the 13th</i>. In
            2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was
            replaced
            by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> and released
            it in
            May 2007. The album reached number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and the lead single, "Makes Me
            Wonder", became the band's first number-one single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.</p>
        <p>In September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album <i>Hands All Over</i>, which was re-released in
            2011 to include the single "Moves like Jagger" featuring Christina Aguilera. While the original version of
            the
            album received mixed reviews, "Moves like Jagger" reached the number one position on the <i>Billboard</i>
            Hot
            100. The band released their fourth album, <i>Overexposed</i>, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the
            album
            were highly successful on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, including second single "One More Night", which
            reached
            number one for 9 weeks straight. Keyboardist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Morton'>PJ
                Morton</a> became an official member of the band in 2012, after gaining little success with his previous
            albums
            as an R&amp;B vocalist. The addition of PJ Morton meant that for the first time, Maroon 5 had six official
            members. The same year, the bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member,
            playing many different instruments (including guitars, percussion and additional keyboards), singing backing
            vocals and also providing samples and other special effects. In 2014, the band signed with <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Interscope_Records'>Interscope Records</a> and released their
            fifth studio album, <i>V</i>. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles
            worldwide.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>1994&#8211;2002: Kara's Flowers and the formation of Maroon 5
    </h3>
    <p>Adam Levine was introduced to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old
        and Dusick was 16. Three of the five members of the band started playing together at age 12. The four original
        members of the band met while attending Brentwood EMH School in Los Angeles. While attending Brentwood EMH
        School, Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers, a
        rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a "collective crush"
        on. In 1997, when the band was playing at a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them
        play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is
        known for his work on <i>Dirty Dancing</i>&#160;&#8211; including "(I've Had) The Time of My Life". Producer Rob
        Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo to offer
        them a deal with Reprise Records. However, after the release of <i>The Fourth World</i>, during Levine and
        Madden's senior year of high school in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s
        Britpop. Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead
        single, "Soap Disco", was a failure. According to Levine, the failure of the album was "a huge disappointment"
        that nearly led them to break up in 1998. The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after one
        month.</p>
    <p>Dusick and Madden attended college locally at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the East coast to
        attend Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York,
        they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they
        wrote.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Musical style and influences</h2>
        <p>Adam Levine has stated: "[E]verything that's written and performed and put together pretty much comes from
            us. I
            just think people would be surprised to know that we&#8217;re a self-contained unit. We&#8217;re a band that
            does their own thing. There&#8217;s no puppet master." However, in an article about the songwriter and
            producer
            Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at least some of the band's songs, such as "Moves like Jagger," are the
            product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article,
            Levine says, "It's almost as if [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at
            the
            right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who
            does
            everything best."</p>
        <p>The band has cited Elita 5, Michael Jackson, The Police, the Bee Gees, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder,
            Tonic,
            Prince, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur'>Tupac Shakur</a> and <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye'>Marvin Gaye</a> as influences. Adam Levine has
            also cited <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Joel'>Billy Joel</a> as an influence. Furthermore,
            guitarist James Valentine said he was influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Frisell'>Bill Frisell</a> and John Scofield, as well as
            the rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by
            piano
            or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like "This Love",
            "Makes
            Me Wonder" and "Misery" have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship,
            while
            their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as "She Will Be Loved" and "Never Gonna Leave This Bed"
            express a
            longing for a romantic relationship. "Makes Me Wonder" has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his
            disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.</p>
        <p>The band's style changes from album to album. <i>Songs About Jane</i> consists of songs about Levine's
            ex-girlfriend Jane. On <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i>, however, the songs are less personal and are
            more
            electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. <i>Hands All Over</i> continues the band's
            lost
            love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single "Moves like
            Jagger", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel
            to
            it. "It was one of those songs that was definitely a risk," Levine said. "It's a bold statement. We've never
            really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm just
            glad
            that everyone likes it." James Valentine called <i>Overexposed</i> "our most 'pop' record ever and we weren&#8217;t
            shy about really going for it." They also have experimented with new wave and disco sounds on several
            albums.
