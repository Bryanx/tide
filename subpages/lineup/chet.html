        <p><b>Nicholas "Nick" James Murphy</b> (born 23 June 1988), better known by his former stage name <b>Chet
            Faker</b>, is an Australian electronica singer and musician. In 2012 he issued an extended play, <i>Thinking
            in Textures</i> and signed to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Records'>Downtown
            Records</a> in the United States. In October 2012 he won Breakthrough Artist of the Year and <i>Thinking in
            Textures</i> won Best Independent Single/EP at the Australian Independent Records Awards.</p>
        <p>In January 2013 the work won Best Independent Release at the Rolling Stone <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia'>Australia</a> Awards for 2012. His cover of
            Blackstreet's "No Diggity" was featured in a 2013 Super Bowl commercial for Beck's Sapphire. In April 2014
            <i>Built on Glass</i>, Faker's debut studio album, was released to generally positive reviews and debuted at
            number one on the Australian ARIA Charts. Three songs from the album were subsequently voted into the top
            ten of Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2014, including the number one spot for "Talk Is Cheap".</p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>Early career</h3>
        <p>Murphy decided to play under a stage name after people came to his shows thinking he was a different and
            already established musician named Nick Murphy. He settled on the name <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Faker'>Chet Faker</a> as an homage to Chet Baker: "I
            listened to a lot of jazz and I was a big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing.
            He had this really fragile vocal style&#8212;this really, broken, close-up and intimate style. The name is
            kind of just an ode to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Baker'>Chet Baker</a> and the mood
            of music he used to play&#8212;something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music." Other
            influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown'
            >Motown</a> albums and his
            father's "chilled out Ibiza CDs".</p>

        <h3><i>Thinking in Textures</i> and collaborations (2011&#8211;13)
        </h3>
        <p>He first rose to prominence after his cover of Blackstreet's "No Diggity" went viral online, reaching number
            one on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypemachine'>Hypemachine</a> chart in May 2011. He
            released his first EP, <i>Thinking in Textures</i>, on 22 March 2012 to positive reviews, being described as
            "wonderfully loungey" and praised for its ability to "mix subtlety with impressive beauty". The EP was also
            popular with fans, with its second single, "I'm Into You", landing at number 24 on radio station Triple J's
            Hottest 100 of 2012.</p>
        <p>Faker has worked with several other artists since the release of his debut EP, including collaborations with
            Flume and remixes of songs by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_MR'>MS MR</a> and The Temper
            Trap. He was a featured vocalist on Say Lou Lou's "Fool of Me", which was named Best New Track by
            <i>Pitchfork</i>
            in May 2013.</p>

        <h3><i>Lockjaw EP</i> and <i>Built on Glass</i> (2013&#8211;15)</h3>
        <p>On 12 August 2013, Faker released a new single, "Melt", featuring American vocalist Kilo Kish. In November
            2013, Flume and Faker released an EP, titled <i>Lockjaw</i>. Faker's debut studio album, <i>Built on
                Glass</i>, was released on 11 April 2014, preceded by the release of its lead single, "Talk Is Cheap",
            and its accompanying music video on 11 February 2014. The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Charts.
        </p>
        <p>In January 2015, it was announced that Faker would perform at the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015.
            Later that month, "Talk Is Cheap" was named the number one song in the 2014 <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_J'>Triple J</a> Hottest 100 countdown, while two of
            his other singles, "Gold" and "1998", also reached the top ten, placing at number 7 and 8 respectively. In
            June, Faker released a new single titled "Bend", a previously unreleased track intended for <i>Built on
                Glass</i>. It was promoted by his Australian <i>Built on Live</i> tour in October.</p>
        <p>Faker released a new EP, <i>Work</i>, a collaboration with London-based DJ Marcus Marr on 4 December 2015.

        <p>On Thursday September 8, Faker announced on Twitter that his next record would be released under his birth
            name <b>Nick Murphy</b>. He said, &#8220;It's been half a decade since I started releasing music as Chet

            I wanted to let you know where its going. The next record will be under my own name, Nick Murphy. Chet Faker
            will always be a part of the music. This is next&#8221;. </p>
