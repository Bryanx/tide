    <section>
        <p><b>White Lies</b> are an English post-punk band from Ealing, London. Formerly known as <b>Fear of Flying</b>,
            the core band members are Harry McVeigh (lead vocals, guitar), Charles Cave (bass guitar and backing
            vocals), and Jack Lawrence-Brown (drums). The band perform live as a five-piece, when sidemen Tommy Bowen
            and Rob Lee join the line up. White Lies' musical style has been described as dark yet uplifting by the
            media, drawing comparisons to Editors, Interpol, Joy Division, and The Killers.</p>
        <h3>Formation</h3>
        <p>White Lies formed in October 2007, after writing songs that they felt didn't suit their original band. After
            delaying their first performance for five months to build up media hype, they earned a recording contract
            with
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_Records'>Fiction Records</a> days after their debut. The
            release of singles "Unfinished Business" and "Death" led to tours and festival appearances in the
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and North America,
            including a headline performance at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC'>BBC</a>
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_1'>Radio 1's Big Weekend</a> and a place
            on the 2009 <i>NME</i> Awards Tour. At the beginning of 2009, White Lies featured in multiple "ones to
            watch"
            polls for the coming year, including the BBC's <i>Sound of 2009</i> poll and the BRITs Critics' Choice
            Award.
        </p>
        <p>White Lies' debut album <i>To Lose My Life...</i>, released in January 2009, hit number one on the UK Albums
            Chart. Their second album <i>Ritual</i> was recorded in 2010, and released on 17 January 2011. <i>Big TV</i>,
            their third studio album, was released on 12 August 2013.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Formation</h3>
        <p>Charles Cave and Jack Lawrence-Brown were both from <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitshanger_Village'
        >Pitshanger Village</a> in North Ealing, and
            first played together in a school show at North <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing'>Ealing</a>
            Primary School. Harry McVeigh (from Shepherd's Bush) joined them two years later, and they began playing
            under
            the name Fear of Flying at the age of fifteen. Cave described the band as a "weekend project", and one of
            many
            groups which they were involved in while at school. Fear of Flying completed one UK tour as a support act,
            as
            well as further slots with The Maccabees, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_T'>Jamie T</a> and
            Laura Marling. They released two double A-side vinyl singles on independent record label Young and Lost
            Club,
            "Routemaster/Round Three" on 7 August 2006 and "Three's a Crowd/Forget-Me-Nots" on 6 December 2006. Both
            vinyls
            were produced by former Blur and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths'>The Smiths</a>
            collaborator, Stephen Street, whom they met through a friend at school. They went on to play the inaugural
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Underage_Festival'>Underage Festival</a> in Victoria Park,
            England on 10 August 2007.</p>
        <p>Two weeks prior to the group starting university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and
            perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that "I felt as
            though I
            couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really
            important to
            anyone, not even me." Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace'>MySpace</a> bulletin stating
            "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that
            reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account "without any token
            farewell
            gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate had an effect on the split, stating that "Maybe a few
            years
            ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...]. In the current climate...we&#8217;d
            have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco,
            Jack
            Brown said that "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that
            we
            felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle
            for
            the songs."</p>

        <h3>Early releases</h3>
        <p>Playing under the new name, White Lies played their first gig at Hoxton Square's Bar &amp; Kitchen on 28
            February
            2008, supporting <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Waterpolo'>Team Waterpolo</a> and
            Semifinalists. The band admitted rehearsing for two months for the gig, as well as putting off their debut
            for
            five months to gather media hype. Following this, the band received numerous record label offers, eventually
            signing to Fiction Records a matter of days after their first performance. The band also signed publishing
            rights to Chrysalis Music Publishing. The band said they chose the name because "white lies are quite
            dark...that's how we see ourselves" and that white lies "protect the upsetting truths" of the band's lyrics.
            Receiving airtime on BBC Radio 1, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Lowe'>Zane Lowe</a> named
            "Death" his "Hottest Record in the World" on 5 February 2008, despite the song having never been officially
            released. Radio 1 would go on to feature the band at Radio 1's Big Weekend in May 2008, where they headlined
            the
            BBC <i>Introducing</i> stage.</p>
        <p>On 10 March 2008, White Lies were announced as one of four bands taking part in the first ever <i>NME</i> New
            Noise Tour (now the <i>NME</i> Radar Tour). The tour visited eleven cities in the UK throughout May 2008.
            The
            band were first featured in the magazine in the issue dated 22 March 2008, appearing in the "Everyone's
            Talking
            About..." section of their <i>Radar</i> article. Live Editor Hamish MacBain described tracks "Death" and
            "XX"
            (later titled "Unfinished Business") - the only two songs available on the band's MySpace - as "...not to
            afraid
            of a little sincerity, not afraid of a little scale". The band released their debut single one month later,
            a
            7-inch vinyl of "Unfinished Business" on 28 April 2008. The limited pressing was released by Chess Club
            Records,
            an independent record label co-founded by drummer Jack Brown. To mark the release, the band supported dEUS
            in
            London's Scala on 16 April 2008, as well as a performance at the 2008 Camden Crawl.</p>

        <h3><i>To Lose My Life...</i> (2008&#8211;2010)</h3>
        <p>They made their television debut on <i>Later... with Jools Holland</i> on 30 May 2008, playing "Unfinished
            Business" and "Death". This marked their final public performance prior to recording their debut album,
            scheduling sessions in ICP Studios in Belgium and Kore Studios in West London. The album was provisionally
            titled <i>To Lose My Life or Lose My Love</i>, with a scheduled release date was set for January 2009. The
            title
            came from a line in the album's title track, "To Lose My Life". During the summer of 2008, the band played
            numerous UK and overseas music festivals, including major festivals Oxegen, T in the Park, and the Reading
            and
            Leeds Festivals. Beginning in September 2008, the band played their first headline tour, performing thirteen
            dates in the United Kingdom. The tour marked the release of "Death" on 22 September 2008, with a further six
            dates played in the United States in October 2008. The tour included an appearance at the CMJ Music Festival
            in
            New York on 23&#8211;24 October, alongside Jay Reatard, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Baby'
            >Amazing Baby</a> and Violens. Following
            this, the band returned to support <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasvegas'>Glasvegas</a> on
            their fifteen date UK tour in November and December 2008. NME.com exclusively announced their debut album
            would
            be released on 12 January 2009, with shortened title <i>To Lose My Life...</i>. The band preceded the album
            with
            the single release of "To Lose My Life" one week earlier. The full-length video for "To Lose My Life"
            premiered
            exclusively on the band's MySpace on 21 November 2008.</p>
        <p>On 11 November 2008, <i>NME</i> announced that White Lies would be taking part in the 2009 ShockWaves <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NME'>NME</a> Awards Tour, alongside Friendly Fires, <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine'>Florence and the Machine</a> and
            headliners Glasvegas. The annual tour, taking place in early 2009, visited seventeen cities in the UK. On 7
            February 2009, it was announced in <i>NME</i> that the entire tour had sold out. On the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester'>Manchester</a> tour date, the band dueted with
            Florence Welch to play "Unfinished Business". The band would later also be announced for Xfm's Winter
            Wonderland
            festival in London, as well as one of four bands playing <i>NME'</i>s Big Gig on 26 February 2009.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of 2009, the band were featured in numerous polls as "ones to watch" for the coming year.
            The
            BBC placed them second in their <i>Sound of 2009</i> poll, as well as coming third in the 2009 BRITs
            Critics'
            Choice Award, behind Florence and the Machine and Little Boots. To mark the album release, "From the Stars"
            appeared as iTunes's "Single of the Week" on 30 December 2008, two weeks prior to the album's release. In
            addition, the band played a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Lounge'>Live Lounge</a> session
            for Jo Whiley's <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1'>BBC Radio 1</a> show on 14 January
            2009, playing "To Lose My Life" as well as a cover of Kanye West's "Love Lockdown". The cover was included
            as a
            b-side to "Farewell to the Fairground", released on 23 March 2009.</p>
        <p>Upon the release of <i>To Lose My Life</i>, White Lies became the first British act in 2009 to achieve a
            number
            one album, and the first album to debut at number one. After charting high in the midweek sales, the album
            beat
            off competition from Lady Gaga, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Script'>The Script</a> and
            Kings of Leon. In support of the release, the band played on Channel 4's <i>Shockwaves Album Chart Show,</i>
            <i>Last
                Call with Carson Daly</i> and the <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, the latter being the band's
            first
            performance on US television. Following supporting <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Patrol'>Snow
                Patrol</a> on their tour of both Ireland and the United Kingdom, the band embarked on their own headline
            world
            tour, playing sold out dates across Europe, North America, Japan and the United Kingdom. While in North
            America,
            the band co-headlined the <i>NME Presents</i> tour with Friendly Fires. The bands were supported by The Soft
            Pack, with White Lies headlining seven of the fifteen dates, including their first appearance at the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest'>South by Southwest</a> festival. During
            the tour, the band were forced to play a shortened, six song set at New York's Bowery Ballroom, due to
            McVeigh
            having throat problems. During summer 2009, the band played a number of major UK and overseas music
            festivals,
            including Rock Werchter, Benic&#224;ssim, Coachella, Glastonbury, Isle of Wight, Lollapalooza, Oxegen, Radio
            1's
            Big Weekend, Reading and Leeds, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskilde'>Roskilde</a> and T in the
            Park. "Death" was re-released on 29 June 2009. To mark the release, live performances from a selection of
            the
            band's festival appearances were broadcast online through the band's web player, titled "The Summer of
            Death".
