        <p><b>Ab&#233;l Makkonen Tesfaye</b> (born 16 February 1990), known professionally as <b>The Weeknd</b>
            (pronounced
            "the weekend"), is a Canadian singer, songwriter and record producer. In late 2010, Tesfaye anonymously
            uploaded
            several songs to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube'>YouTube</a> under the name "The Weeknd". He
            released three nine-track mixtapes throughout 2011: <i>House of Balloons</i>, <i>Thursday</i>, and <i>Echoes
                of Silence</i>, which were critically acclaimed. The following year, he released a compilation album
            <i>Trilogy</i>, thirty tracks consisting of remastered versions of the mixtape material and three additional
            songs. It was released under <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Records'>Republic Records</a> and
            his own label XO.</p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Ab&#233;l Makkonen Tesfaye was born on 16 February 1990, in Scarborough, Ontario, a district of Toronto. He
            is
            the only child of Makkonen and Samra Tesfaye, who were Ethiopian migrants to <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada'>Canada</a> in the 1980s. He was raised in Scarborough, a
            diversely multicultural neighborhood within the city. During The Weeknd's youth, his mother would work
            several
            jobs to supplement the family, often as a nurse and caterer, while also attending night school. His father
            later
            abandoned the family, prompting The Weeknd's maternal grandmother to care for him while he was young. This
            allowed for him to become fluent in Amharic, with the Semitic language acting as his first language. She
            would
            also take him to services at an <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Orthodox'>Ethiopian
                Orthodox</a>
            church.</p>
        <p>The Weeknd started smoking marijuana at age 11, and later moved on to harder drugs. He has credited devising
            his
            stage name following dropping out of high school in 2007, adopting the name "The Weeknd" after he and a
            friend
            "left [school] one weekend and never came home". The spelling was modified to avoid trademark issues with
            the
            Canadian band The Weekend.</p>

        <h2>Recognition</h2>
        <p>The Weeknd has received praise from many musical artists. Veteran artist Babyface who spoke positively about
            The
            Weeknd stated, "I do love The Weeknd, and I love how, whoever he&#8217;s working with, they&#8217;re using
            pieces of R&amp;B with other things that feel really great. [...] It&#8217;s promising in the sense that I
            think
            there are other unknowns that will come forward and get back to being musicians. I think more than anything,
            what I miss is the musicians being part of the process." Drake, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Jonas'>Nick
                Jonas</a> and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Lo'>Tove Lo</a> have cited him as a musical
            influence.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>The Weeknd began dating <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Hadid'>Bella Hadid</a> at the beginning of
            2015;
            the couple were first seen together in April at Coachella. Hadid has starred in his music video "In the
            Night"
            in December 2015. They also made their red carpet appearance as a couple at the 2016 Grammys in February.
        </p>
        <p>His hairstyle&#8212;which is partly inspired by Jean-Michel Basquiat&#8212;is by far his most recognizable
            trait.
            "There's not much to maintaining it," he says &#8212; just a hard shampoo every once in a while. He began
            growing it out around 2011: "I want to be remembered as iconic and different," he says. "So I was like,
            'Fuck it
            &#8212; I'm gonna let my hair just be what it wants.' I'll probably cut it if it starts interfering with my
            sight. I can kind of see it right now. But if I cut it, I'd look like everyone else. And that's just so
            boring
            to me."</p>
        <p>On social media outlets such as Twitter, he suffixed his name with "xo". According to Hoby, it is meant as an
            emoticon for "a kiss and a hug", while VH1's Zara Golden said that it is instead a reference to his
            recreational
            use of ecstasy and oxycodone.</p>
