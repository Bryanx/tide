            <b>Disclosure</b> are an English electronic music duo consisting of brothers Howard (born 11 May 1994) and
            Guy Lawrence (born 25 May 1991). The siblings grew up in Reigate, Surrey. Their debut studio album,
            <i>Settle</i>, released on 3 June 2013 by PMR, was nominated for Best Dance/Electronica Album at the 2014
            Grammy Awards. They released a second studio album, <i>Caracal</i>, on 25 September 2015 which was also
            nominated for Best Dance/Electronica Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards. On 24 June 2016, they headlined the
            Friday line-up on the "Other Stage" at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival'>Glastonbury
            Festival</a> in the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Born to professional musician parents, their father played in rock bands including 'No Angry Man' and 'The
            Look
            Book' alongside his brother and Guy's godfather, and is now a professional auctioneer, whilst their mother,
            a
            session musician, fronted bands, toured on cruises, sang advert jingles, and was one of the first performers
            to
            entertain the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army'>British Army</a> after their recapture of the
            Falkland Islands. Guy started playing the drums at the age of three, and Howard started playing bass at the
            age
            of eight. Both also learned to play guitar and piano and Howard to sing.</p>
        <p>They both attended <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reigate'>Reigate</a> College. During this period the
            boys
            studied music and music technology. By age 15 Howard listened mainly to funk, soul and maudlin singers,
            whilst
            Guy listened predominantly to hip hop, dubstep and was the drummer in an indie-style guitar band with school
            friends.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Whilst Guy was attending Reigate College, he enjoyed studying classical music, especially the likes of Bach
            and
            Claude Debussy. A teenage interest in the music and production techniques of Detroit-based rapper and record
            producer J Dilla, led him through hip hop to attending dubstep gigs as a student; but he enjoyed house music
            more as a creation, and began studying it and introducing his brother to it. Studying and being primarily
            influenced by artists including Joy Orbison, James Blake, Burial and Mount Kimbie, they began studying their
            influences, leading them back in time to Chicago house, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit'>Detroit</a>
            techno, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_garage'>UK garage</a> and 2-step garage.</p>

        <h3>2010&#8211;11: Debut</h3>
        <p>The brothers started de-constructing and copying the music that Guy had heard at gigs in a room above their
            father's auction house, and then making music in the same room in a style they refer to as "electronic house
            music with a pop structure", uploading it to Myspace. This got them an early record deal, and a UK tour
            mixing
            live music gigs with occasional DJ sets, where in <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester'>Manchester</a>
            they played a set before Todd Edwards, and gained after gig all-night conversation.</p>
        <p>The duo's first single "Offline Dexterity" was released on 29 August 2010. They signed to the new PMR record
            label on its formation in January 2011, and released their second single "Carnival"/"I Love...That You Know"
            on
            13 June 2011. This got them a management deal with Sam Evitt and Jack Street's Method Management who they
            are
            still managed by.</p>

        <h3>2012&#8211;14: Commercial success and <i>Settle</i></h3>
        <p>Disclosure picked up their first significant national radio support upon the release of the "Tenderly"/"Flow"
            single in January 2012. The single led to significant interest in the subsequent June 2012 EP <i>The
                Face</i>,
            released on Greco-Roman. The EP included the popular remix of "Running" by <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Ware'>Jessie Ware</a> a fellow PMR artist which charted in
            both
            the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands'>Netherlands</a> and Belgium, as well as becoming a
            fixture
            of the 2012 Festival Circuit and featuring on the annual edition of <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Mac'>Annie Mac</a> presents.</p>
        <p>Through collaboration with other artists signed to Method Management, the group had their first UK hit in
            October
            2012 with "Latch", co-written with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Napes'>Jimmy Napes</a> and
            featuring
            the vocals from Sam Smith, which peaked at number 11 in the UK Singles Chart.</p>
        <p>The group maintained their momentum into 2013 &#8211; they were voted into the BBC Radio 1xtra 'Hot Ten For
            2013'
            and scored two consecutive top 10 hit singles in "White Noise" (number 2) (with AlunaGeorge) and "You &amp;
            Me"
            (number 10) (with Eliza Doolittle). These three singles were collected on an EP, <i>The Singles</i>. They
            released their debut studio album, <i>Settle</i>, on PMR Records on 3 June 2013 and was met with commercial
            and
            critical success, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, charting in many countries across Europe
            and
            Australia, and receiving four stars from <i>The Guardian</i> and a 9.1 score on <i>Pitchfork</i>. They
            performed
            twice at Glastonbury Festival 2013 and appeared on <i>Later... with Jools Holland</i>. The album was
            nominated
            for a <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award'>Grammy Award</a> for Best Dance Album.</p>
        <p>In 2013, Disclosure embarked on a worldwide tour of more than 40 European, American, and Canadian cities
            including high-profile music festivals such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza'>Lollapalooza</a> Music Festival in Chicago, and <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasquatch!_Music_Festival'>Sasquatch! Music Festival</a> in
            Washington
            State. The same year they established the record label Method Records; its roster includes Friend Within,
            Karen
            Harding, Lxury, and Tourist. A sub label was introduced in February 2015 called Method White, releasing more
            underground tracks through it. The first release was Wolfsbane by Jonas Rathsman. Since then <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/M._J._Cole'>M. J. Cole</a> and Eats Everything have released tracks
            through the label.</p>

        <h3> 2015: <i>Caracal</i></h3>
        <p>Following the worldwide success of their debut studio album, <i>Settle</i> and a worldwide tour, the duo
            began
            working on their second studio album, <i>Caracal</i>, featuring vocals from Sam Smith, Lorde, Gregory
            Porter,
            Lion Babe, Kwabs, The Weeknd, Nao, Miguel, Jordan Rakei and Brendan Reilly. The week of its release,
            <i>Caracal</i> earned the group their second consecutive number one album in the UK Albums Chart.</p>
        <p>The music videos for official singles from the album published on <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube'>YouTube</a>
            are interconnected and follow a story line, each newly released video furthering the plot. The videos follow
            a
            young woman in a sci-fi, dystopian world who is, for some unknown reason, being chased by the police.</p>
        <p>Three singles were released prior to the album: "Omen", "Holding On" and "Jaded". Two promotional singles
            were
            also released: "Willing and Able" and "Hourglass". The album was released on 25 September 2015 by PMR and
            Island. The album was also nominated for Best Dance/Electronica Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards.</p>
