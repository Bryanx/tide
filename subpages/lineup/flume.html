            Streten announced that he had left the project, citing: "Emoh and I have been moving in different directions
            creatively, we haven't made any music together in quite a while. Our final joint project is a
            soon-to-be-released EP that we completed last year. That will be the last What So Not project I'll be
            creatively involved with."</p>
