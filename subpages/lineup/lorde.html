        <p><b>Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor</b> (born 7 November 1996), better known by her stage name <b>Lorde</b>
            (pronounced "lord"), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. Born in <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Takapuna'
            >Takapuna</a> and raised in
            Devonport, Auckland, she became interested in performing as a child. In her early teens, she signed with <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group'>Universal Music Group</a> and was later
            paired with the songwriter and record producer Joel Little, who has co-written and produced most of Lorde's
            works. Her first major release, <i>The Love Club EP</i>, was commercially released in March 2013. The EP
            reached
            number two on the national record charts of New Zealand and Australia.</p>
        <h3>Success</h3>
        <p>In mid-2013, Lorde released her debut single "Royals". It became an international crossover hit and made
            Lorde
            the youngest solo artist (and the only New Zealander) to achieve a US number-one single on the
            <i>Billboard</i>
            Hot 100 since 1987. In late 2013, she released her debut studio album, <i>Pure Heroine</i>. The record
            topped
            the charts of New Zealand and Australia and reached number three on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. Its
            following
            singles include "Tennis Court", "Team", "No Better" and "Glory and Gore". In 2014, Lorde released "Yellow
            Flicker Beat" as a single from the soundtrack for <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8211; Part 1</i>.</p>
        <p>Lorde's music consists of subgenres such as dream pop and indietronica. She has earned two Grammy Awards, a
            Brit
            Award and ten New Zealand Music Awards. In 2013, she was named among <i>Time</i>'s most influential
            teenagers in the world, and in the following year, she was in <i>Forbes</i>'s "30 Under 30" list.

        <h2>Life and career</h2>
        <h3>1996&#8211;2008: Early life</h3>
        <p>Of Croatian and Irish descent, Ella Yelich-O'Connor was born in Takapuna to Vic O'Connor, a civil engineer,
            and
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Yelich'>Sonja Yelich</a> (Croatian: <i>Sonja Jeli&#263;</i>),
            a poet, on 7 November 1996. She was raised in the nearby suburb of Devonport with her two sisters, Jerry and
            India, and her brother, Angelo.</p>
        <p>At age five, she joined a drama group and developed public speaking skills. At that same time, Lorde was
            attending <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauxhall_School'>Vauxhall School</a> and later Belmont
            Intermediate School. Her mother encouraged her to read a range of genres, which Lorde cited as a lyrical
            influence, "I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She'd give me a mixture of
            kid
            and adult books too, there weren't really any books I wasn't allowed to read. I remember reading <i>Feed</i>
            by
            M.T. Anderson when I was six, and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Frame'>Janet Frame</a> really young too."</p>
        <p>Lorde played netball at a young age alongside Vauxhall classmate Eliza McCartney, who later became an Olympic
            bronze medallist in the pole vault.</p>

        <h3>2009&#8211;11: Career beginnings</h3>
        <p>In November 2012, Lorde self-released the record, entitled <i>The Love Club EP</i>, through her <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundCloud'>SoundCloud</a> account for free download. After being
            freely downloaded 60,000 times, UMG decided to commercially release the EP for sales in March 2013. The EP
            peaked at number two on the record charts of New Zealand and Australia. In June of that year, "Royals" was
            released as a single from the EP. The single became a crossover hit, peaking atop the US <i>Billboard</i>
            Hot
            100 for nine consecutive weeks. Consequently, Lorde became the youngest solo artist to achieve a number-one
            single in the US with "Royals", since Tiffany's "I Think We're Alone Now" (1987). The track eventually won
            the
            2013 APRA Silver Scroll Award, and two <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards'>Grammy
                Awards</a> for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year at the 2014 Grammy Awards.</p>
        <p>In September 2013, Lorde released her debut studio album, <i>Pure Heroine</i>. The album topped the charts of
            New
            Zealand and Australia and reached the top five of several national charts, including Canada, Ireland, Norway
            and
            the United Kingdom. In the U.S., <i>Pure Heroine</i> peaked at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and
            had
            sold 1.33 million copies by 2014. Worldwide, <i>Pure Heroine</i> had sold 1.5 million copies by the end of
            2013.
            The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>
        <p>The release of <i>Pure Heroine</i> was preceded by four singles: "Tennis Court" was released in June 2013,
            topping the New Zealand Singles Chart; the third single, "Team", became a top-ten hit worldwide; and "No
            Better", a song only included on the extended version of <i>Pure Heroine</i>, and "Glory and Gore" were
            released
            as the two final singles from the record, respectively. In September 2013, Lorde's cover version of the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears'>Tears for Fears</a> single "Everybody Wants
            to Rule the World", produced by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Levine'>Michael A.
                Levine</a> and Lucas Cantor, was included on <i>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</i> film soundtrack.</p>
        <p>In November 2013, Lorde signed a publishing deal with Songs Music Publishing, worth a reported US$2.5
            million,
            after a bidding war between various companies, including <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music_Entertainment'>Sony Music Entertainment</a> and her
            label UMG. The agreement gives the publisher the right to license Lorde's music for films and advertising.
            Late
            that year, she started a relationship with photographer James Lowe.</p>

        <p>In December 2013, Lorde announced that she had begun writing material for her second studio album. In June
            2014,
            Lorde said that her second studio album was in its early stages and that, so far, it was "totally different"
            from her debut album. In the first half of 2014, Lorde headlined various festivals, including the Laneway
            Festival in Sydney, Australia, the three South American editions of Lollapalooza&#8212;Chile, Santiago;
            Buenos
            Aires, Argentina; and S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil&#8212;and the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_Festival'
            >Coachella Festival</a> in California.
        </p>
        <p>To promote <i>The Love Club EP</i> and <i>Pure Heroine</i>, Lorde embarked on an international tour, the
            first
            leg of which was held in North America in early 2014. She later announced the Australian leg, held in July,
            and
            the second North American leg, held in August. In April of that year, Lorde performed "All Apologies" with
            the
            surviving members of Nirvana during the band's induction ceremony at the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>On 1 August 2014, Lorde performed at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza'>Lollapalooza</a>
            again in Grant Park, Chicago. Lorde's set was critically well received, with <i>Billboard</i> selecting it
            as
            the fifth-best performance of the festival, while <i>Rolling Stone</i> deemed it the best segment of the
            Chicago
            event.</p>
        <p>On 29 September 2014, Lorde released "Yellow Flicker Beat" as the first single from the soundtrack album for
            the
            film <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay &#8212; Part 1</i>; Lorde oversaw the collation of the album's content,
            in
            addition to contributing vocals to several songs. By her 18th birthday in November 2014, it was estimated
            that
            Lorde was worth NZ$11 million. In 2015, Lorde was featured on "Magnets", a track on Disclosure's
            second studio album <i>Caracal</i>. At the 2016 Brit Awards, Lorde gave a performance of "Life on Mars" in
            tribute to the late English singer David Bowie.</p>
