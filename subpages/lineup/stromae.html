        <p><b>Paul Van Haver</b> (born 12 March 1985, Brussels), better known by his stage name <b>Stromae</b>, is a
            Belgian
            musician, singer, rapper and songwriter. Stromae was born to a Rwandan father, Pierre Rutare, and a Belgian
            mother, Miranda Marie Van Haver. He is originally from Laeken, in Brussels. He established himself in both
            the hip hop and electronic music genres. Stromae came to wide public attention in 2009 with his song "Alors
            on danse", which became a number one in several European countries. In 2013, his second album <i>Racine
                carr&#233;e</i> was a commercial success, selling 2 million copies in France alone and nearly 600,000
            units elsewhere.</p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Stromae was born in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium'>Belgium</a> to a <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi'>Tutsi</a> father and a <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish'>Flemish</a>
            mother. His father, a successful Rwandan architect, was killed during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. His mother
            raised him and his four siblings in Brussels, and later in a nearby suburb. She encouraged each of her
            children
            to play a sport and an instrument. Stromae studied percussion. His mother placed him in a Roman Catholic <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit'>Jesuit</a> school after he failed in the public school
            system at
            the age of sixteen. He formed a small rap group with friends while still in school. His early influences
            included Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel, Cuban son, and Congolese rumba. He did not always feel that
            he
            was from Belgium, even though he was raised as a Belgian. He always saw himself more connected to his
            Rwandan
            side; some believe that is the source of his talent. This "outsider" image became part of his appeal.</p>

        <h2>Musical career</h2>
        <h3>2000&#8211;07: Early career</h3>
        <p>In 2000, he appeared as a rapper called Opsmaestro, though he later changed his stage name to "Stromae",
            which is
            "Maestro" with the syllables reversed in a French vernacular practice called verlan.</p>
        <p>At the age of 18, he founded a rap group called "Suspicion", along with rapper "J.E.D.I." in Eichof. They
            produced the song and music video "Faut que t'arr&#234;te le Rap..." before J.E.D.I. decided to leave the
            rap
            duo. To finance his private school education, Van Haver worked part-time in the hospitality industry, but
            his
            academic performance wasn't up to standard. It was only later, when he registered at the Institut national
            de
            radio&#233;lectricit&#233; et cin&#233;matographie, that he released his first album "Juste un cerveau, un
            flow,
            un fond et un mic...".</p>
        <h3>2007&#8211;08: Debut EP and record career</h3>
        <p>In 2007, during his studies at the film school of Brussels, Stromae decided to concentrate fully on his
            musical
            career. This resulted in his debut-EP "Juste un cerveau, un flow, un fond et un mic&#8230;". In 2008 he
            signed a
            4-year record deal with "Because Music" and "Kiloma&#238;tre".</p>
        <h3>2009&#8211;12: Breakthrough and international success
