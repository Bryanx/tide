        <p><b>U2</b> are an Irish rock band from Dublin. Formed in 1976, the group consists of <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono'>Bono</a> (lead vocals and guitar), the Edge (guitar, keyboards,
            and backing vocals), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Clayton'>Adam Clayton</a> (bass guitar), and <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Mullen_Jr.'>Larry Mullen Jr.</a> (drums and percussion). U2's
            early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of
            popular
            music. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals.
            Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical
            concerns.
        </p>
        <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <p>U2 have released 13 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time, having
            sold
            more than 170&#160;million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and,
            in
            2005, were inducted into the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame'>Rock and Roll
                Hall
                of Fame</a> in their first year of eligibility. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked U2 at number 22 in its list
            of
            the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have
            campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes, including Amnesty International, the ONE/DATA
            campaigns,
            Product Red, War Child and the Edge's Music Rising.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Formation and early years (1976&#8211;1980)</h3>
        <p>The band formed in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin'>Dublin</a> on 25 September 1976. Larry Mullen,
            Jr.,
            then a 14-year-old student at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, posted a note on the school's notice board
            in
            search of musicians for a new band&#8212;six people responded. Setting up in his kitchen, Mullen was on
            drums,
            with Paul Hewson (Bono) on lead vocals; David Evans (the Edge) and his older brother <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dik_Evans'>Dik Evans</a> on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the
            Evans
            brothers on bass guitar; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen. Mullen
            later described it as "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any
            chance I
            had of being in charge." Soon after, the group settled on the name "Feedback" because it was one of the few
            technical terms they knew. Martin was the first to drop out of the group, and McCormick left within a few
            weeks
            of the first practice. Most of the group's initial material consisted of cover songs, which the band
            admitted
            was not their forte. Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts, such as the
            Jam,
            the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical
            proficiency
            was not a prerequisite to being successful.</p>

        <h2>Campaigning and activism</h2>

        <p>Since the early 1980s, the members of U2&#8212;as a band and individually&#8212;have collaborated with other
            musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social
            injustice.</p>
        <p>In 1984, Bono and Adam Clayton participated in Band Aid to raise money for the 1983&#8211;85 famine in
            Ethiopia.
            This initiative produced the hit charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas?", which would be the first
            among
            several collaborations between U2 and Bob Geldof. In July 1985, U2 played Live Aid, a follow-up to Band
            Aid's
            efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by World Vision, later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the
            famine
            first hand. Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his
            songwriting.</p>
