        <p><b>Kensington</b> are a Dutch rock band from Utrecht, Netherlands. Formed in 2005, the band has since
            released
            two EPs and three studio albums: <i>Borders</i> (2010), <i>Vultures</i> (2012) and <i>Rivals</i> (2014). The
            band consists of vocalist/guitarist Eloi Youssef, guitarist/vocalist Casper Starreveld, bassist Jan Haker
            and
            drummer Niles Vandenberg.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Early years (2005&#8211;08)</h3>
        <p>Kensington was formed in 2005 by singer/guitarist Casper Starreveld, bass player Jan Haker and drummer Lucas
            Lenselink. Singer/guitarist Eloi Youssef joined the band in 2006. Kensington's first official releases
            appear in
            2007 on Stuck in a Day Records: two-song promo single <i>An Introduction To...</i> and the five-song <i>Kensington
                EP</i>. This self-produced EP was recorded in the Second Moon Studio of Dutch folk singer Hessel van der
            Kooij, on the island of <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Terschelling'>Terschelling</a> and was mixed and
            mastered by Martijn Groeneveld in the Mailmen Studios in Utrecht. The <i>Kensington EP</i> received good
            reviews, from Dutch music platform MusicFromNL for example, which showers it with praise. "The band
            effortlessly
            combines different styles and moods into a comprehensive sound. (...) The quartet from <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht'>Utrecht</a> show musical sophistication on this debut.
            These
            five songs exhibit Kensington's prowess, originality and musicality. It is a well-produced, diverse and
            catchy
            record." The band played several shows in 2007 with Dutch touring showcase festival the Popronde, and as
            support
            for bands such as American indie rock band Movies With Heroes. They also appeared in TV shows on Dutch music
            channel TMF and in online and printed music magazines such as alternative pop platform 3VOOR12.</p>
        <p>At the end of 2007, drummer Lucas Lenselink decided to leave the band. Lenselink felt that his own ambitions
            do
            not match those of his band mates anymore. He explained that a career in music is not what he envisions for
            himself and that he wanted to focus on finishing his studies at university. After auditioning a couple of
            new
            drummers, Niles Vandenberg, former drummer of Griffin, joined Kensington in February 2008. Niles does share
            the
            ambitions of the rest of the band and is seen as "a great addition".</p>
        <p>Together with Niles, the band start working on their second EP. The EP, titled <i>Youth</i>, was released on
            12
            December 2008 on Dutch indie label Snowstar Records. <i>Youth</i> received positive reviews from
            MusicFromNL,
            amongst others, which praises the inventiveness of the song structures and the professional-sounding
            production.
            The <i>Youth EP</i> generates attention from several record labels and the band eventually signs with
            Bladehammer/EMI. A label that shares the band's high ambitions.</p>
        <p>Dutch radio station 3FM included Kensington in its Serious Talent program. A program that aims to support
            local
            talent by providing air play on 3FM and by hosting shows around the country. In addition to this, Kensington
            were invited to be the support act for Razorlight, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance'>My
                Chemical Romance</a> and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombats'>The Wombats</a> for their shows
            in
            the Netherlands.</p>

        <h3><i>Borders</i> (2009&#8211;11)</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 2009, Kensington traveled to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds'>Leeds</a> to start
            work
            on their first album with producer James Kenosha, in the studio of Kaiser Chiefs's keyboardist Nick Baines.
            The
            album, titled <i>Borders</i>, comes out on July 17, 2010. The album was mastered by John Davis, who has
            worked
            with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Monkeys'>Arctic Monkeys</a> as well. Their first single
            "Youth"
            received regular airplay on 3FM, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV'>MTV</a> and TMF, and entered the
            Dutch
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Top_100'>Single Top 100</a> chart at number 78. The release of <i>Borders</i>
            also saw Eloi Youssef becoming the main lead vocalist of the band, where he had shared lead vocalist duties
            with
            Casper Starreveld on the band's earlier releases. The latter chose to focus on playing guitar and singing
            backup
            vocals. The band spent the rest of 2010 touring the Netherlands] with pop punk band MakeBelieve and several
            support acts. The second single to come off <i>Borders</i>, "When It All Falls Down", was released in
            November
            that year.</p>
        <p>On July 10, 2012 the band released a third single, "No Way Out", which starred in its video, Hollywood actor
            Michael Koltes and Brazilian supermodel Ana Ara&#250;jo. The video was filmed in London in June and produced
            by
            Juriaan and Boris Booij, Dutch film-makers stationed in London.</p>
        <p>Kensington played several music festivals during the summer of 2012, such as the Indian Summer Festival. The
            band
            spent the remainder of the year touring the country in what is their biggest tour to date. The
            <i>Vultures</i>
            club tour has 18 dates, almost half of which sell out well in advance, including hometown venue Tivoli
            Utrecht.
        </p>
        <p>On 20 November, the band announced that <i>Vultures</i> would be released in Germany, Belgium, Austria,
            Switzerland and South Korea. The international version was released on 11 January 2013 through Universal
            Music.
            It included a previously unreleased song titled "Home Again", which featured in the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Wolfskin'>Jack Wolfskin</a> winter campaign commercial. The
            song
            became popular, and eventually was also released as a single. During the last show of the <i>Vultures</i>
            Tour
            in Tivoli Utrecht, the band filmed a video for "Home Again". It was directed and edited by Boris Booij.</p>
        <p>Kensington kick-started the year 2013 with eleven shows at the <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosonic_Noorderslag'>Eurosonic Noorderslag</a> Festival and a short
            5-stop
            sold-out tour in the Netherlands in March and April. The band also played shows with <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Door_Cinema_Club'>Two Door Cinema Club</a> and Dutch rockband
            Kane.
