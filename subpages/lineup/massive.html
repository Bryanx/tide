        <p><b>Massive Attack</b> are an English trip hop group formed in 1988 in Bristol, consisting of Robert "3D" Del
            Naja, Grant "Daddy G" Marshall and formerly Andy "Mushroom" Vowles ("Mush"). Their debut album <i>Blue
                Lines</i> was released in 1991, with the single "Unfinished Sympathy" reaching the charts and later
            being voted the 63rd greatest song of all time in a poll by <i>NME</i>. 1998's <i>Mezzanine</i>, containing
            "Teardrop", and 2003's <i>100th Window</i> charted in the UK at number one. Both <i>Blue Lines</i> and <i>Mezzanine</i>
            feature in <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>
        <p>The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including a Brit Award&#8212;winning Best
            British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards. They have released five studio albums that
            have sold over 11 million copies worldwide.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>DJs <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Daddy_G'>Daddy G</a> and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Vowles'>Andrew Vowles</a> and graffiti artist-turned-rapper <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Del_Naja'>Robert Del Naja</a> met as members of partying
            collective The Wild Bunch. One of the first homegrown soundsystems in the UK, The Wild Bunch became dominant
            on the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol'>Bristol</a> club scene in the mid-1980s.</p>
        <p>Massive Attack started as a spin-off production trio in 1988, with the independently released song, "Any
            Love", sung by falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy, and then, with considerable backing from
            Neneh Cherry, they signed to Circa Records in 1990&#160;&#8211; committing to deliver six studio albums and
            a "<i>best of</i>" compilation. Circa became a subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, Virgin Records,
            which in turn was acquired by EMI. <i>Blue Lines</i> (1991), was co-produced by <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Dollar'>Jonny Dollar</a> and Cameron McVey, who also became
            their first manager. Geoff Barrow, who went on to form Portishead, was an intern and trainee tape operator
            at Bristol's Coach House studio when the album was recorded. McVey (credited at the time as 'Booga Bear')
            and his wife, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neneh_Cherry'>Neneh Cherry</a> provided crucial financial
            support and in-kind assistance to the early careers of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky during this
            period, even paying regular wages to them through their <i>Cherry Bear Organisation</i>. Massive Attack used
            guest vocalists, interspersed with Del Naja and Marshall's (initially Tricky's) own sprechgesang stylings,
            on top of what became regarded as an essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound
            that fused down-tempo hip hop, soul, reggae and other eclectic references, musical and lyrical.</p>
        <p>In the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and
            working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio's
            musical director, acrimoniously left Massive Attack in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two
            members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja's side in the effective
            firing of Vowles and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant
            Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall returned
            to a studio role in 2005, having joined the touring line-up in 2003 and 2004.</p>

        <h3>'Fire Sale' exhibition</h3>
        <p>Del Naja's solo art show was held at the Lazarides gallery in central London, England, UK from 24 May to 22
            June 2013. The show's content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that
            Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was
            hand-printed and finished. The show also featured three one-off 'digital infinity mirrors', two of which
            contained phrases supplied by Reprieve that were extracted from drone pilot dialogues. Del Naja performed as
            a DJ during the opening night on 23 May 2013.</p>
        <h3>Massive Attack vs Adam Curtis</h3>
        <p>Del Naja conceived and designed an eight-night festival with filmmaker Adam Curtis&#160;&#8212;in
            collaboration with UVA (United Visual Artists)&#8212; that premiered in Manchester, England, UK in July
            2013. The festival featured Curtis's film, unofficially titled <i>The Plan</i>, which was projected on a
            huge screen surrounding the audience, while music from Massive Attack was interweaved throughout the film.
            Del Naja, who orchestrated the film's soundtrack, described the experience as a &#8220;collective
            hallucination&#8221; and the film was also shown at the Manchester Festival in July 2013. The show was
            performed at the Ruhr International Festival in Germany in August 2013 and the Park Avenue Armory in New
            York City in September 2013.</p>
        <h2>Activism and politics</h2>
        <p>Del Naja has been critical of the government policies of the UK. He was strongly opposed to the 2003 war
            against Iraq, and with fellow musician Damon Albarn personally paid for full page adverts in the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NME'>NME</a> magazine.</p>
        <p>In 2005 Del Naja organised and performed at a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami Relief with Adrian Utley
            and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Barrow'>Geoff Barrow</a> of Portishead. The two-night event
            featured Massive Attack, Portishead, Robert Plant, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coral'>The
                Coral</a> and Damon Albarn. Del Naja and Marshall performed three shows in 2005 in support of Hoping, an
            organisation that helps raise money, support projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza
            strip and the west bank, Lebanon and Syria.</p>
        <p>Del Naja, musicians Damon Albarn and Brian Eno, and <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Visual_Artists'>United Visual Artists</a> contributed to a
            demonstration against the renewal of the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_nuclear_programme'>Trident
                nuclear programme</a> that was held on board the Arctic Sunrise on the River Thames in 2007.</p>
        <p>In 2008, Massive Attack curated the annual Meltdown festival on London's south bank. During the two weeks of
            live performance, cinema and art, they worked with human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and his Reprieve
            organisation which uses the law to enforce the human rights of prisoners.</p>
        <p>In 2010, the video for shot by Oliver Chanarin and Adam Bloomberg for the song "Saturday come slow",
            featuring Damon Albarn, drew attention to the use of music in torture. In 2010, Massive Attack donated the
            income from a Lincoln car commercial to the clean up campaign after the BP oil spill disaster.</p>
        <p>Massive Attack donated all proceeds from their 2010 EP Atlas Air this week for War Child, a charity the band
            previously supported when they contributed to the HELP album.</p>
        <p>Massive Attack have previously played two shows in Israel, but have declined recent offers. They have
            described this "not an action of aggression towards the Israeli people" but "towards the [Israeli]
            government and its policies", arguing that "the Palestinians [in Gaza and the west bank] have no access to
            the same fundamental benefits that the Israelis do."</p>
        <p>Del Naja and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke'>Thom Yorke</a> of <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead'>Radiohead</a> threw an unofficial party at the occupied <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS'>UBS</a> building in the city of London in December 2011, in support
            for the international Occupy movement.</p>
        <p>On 14 November 2012, on the eve of the Bristol Mayor election the band caused some surprise by endorsing
            independent millionaire and former LibDem George Ferguson, citing the need for a mayor who would help
            facilitate creative projects to the city, and wasn't simply following a party political agenda. Previously,
            Del Naja had openly criticised Ferguson for being a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, an
            organisation dating back to the 16th century which had many connections with the Bristol slave trade.</p>
        <p>During their concert at Istanbul, Massive Attack named those who died in anti-government protests on the
            outdoor screen at their back with following sentences, <i>Their killers are still out there</i> and <i>We
                won't forget Soma</i>.</p>
        <p>In July Del Naja and Marshall visited the Bourge-El Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon to meet with Palestinian
            volunteers at an educational centre. The band's profit from the show in Byblos was donated to the
            centre.</p>
