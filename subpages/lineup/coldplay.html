        <p><b>Coldplay</b> are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and pianist <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin'>Chris Martin</a> and lead guitarist <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Buckland'>Jonny Buckland</a> at <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London'>University College London</a> (UCL). After
            they
            formed under the name Pectoralz, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Berryman'>Guy Berryman</a> joined
            the
            group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Champion'>Will
                Champion</a> joined as a drummer and backing vocalist, completing the performing line-up. Creative
            Director
            Phil Harvey is often referred to as the official fifth member by the band. The band renamed themselves
            "Coldplay" in 1998, before recording and releasing three EPs: <i>Safety</i> in 1998, <i>Brothers &amp;
                Sisters</i> as a single in 1999, and <i>The Blue Room</i> in the same year. <i>The Blue Room</i> was
            their
            first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.</p>
            <h3>Fame</h3>
        <p>They achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single "Yellow" in 2000. This was followed by their
            debut
            album <i>Parachutes</i> released the same year, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second
            album, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won multiple awards,
            including <i>NME</i>'s Album of the Year. Their next release, <i>X&amp;Y</i>, the best-selling album
            worldwide
            in 2005, was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release, though some critics felt that it was
            inferior to
            its predecessor. The band's fourth studio album, <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i> (2008),
            was
            produced by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno'>Brian Eno</a> and released again to largely
            positive
            reviews, earning several <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award'>Grammy Award</a> nominations and
            wins
            at the 51st Grammy Awards. On 24 October 2011, they released their fifth studio album, <i>Mylo Xyloto</i>,
            which
            received mixed to positive reviews, topped the charts in over 34 countries, and was the UK's best-selling
            rock
            album of 2011. On 16 May 2014, they released their sixth album, titled <i>Ghost Stories</i>, which also
            received
            mixed to positive reviews and topped the iTunes Store albums charts in over 100 countries. On 4 December
            2015,
            the band released their seventh album, <i>A Head Full of Dreams</i>, which reached the top two in most major
            markets, but received generally mixed reviews.</p>
        <p>The band has won 62 awards from 209 nominations throughout their career, including nine Brit Awards&#8212;winning
            Best British Group four times&#8212;five MTV Video Music Awards and seven <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards'>Grammy Awards</a> from 31 nominations. Coldplay have
            sold
            more than 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In
            December
            2009, <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers voted the group the fourth-best artist of the 2000s. Coldplay have been
            an
            active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Trade_Fair'>Make Trade Fair</a> campaign and Amnesty
            International.
            The group have also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, Hope
            for
            Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, The Secret Policeman's Ball, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Relief'>Sport Relief</a> and the UK's Teenage Cancer Trust.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>1996&#8211;99: Formation and first years</h3>
        <p>Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London (UCL) in
            September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group
            called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman, a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the
            group,
            who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also
            had
            recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying classics at the University of Oxford, to
            be
            the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. The band's line-up
            was
            completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano,
            guitar,
            bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience). The band
            finally
            settled on the name "Coldplay" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the
            name
            for his group.</p>
        <p>By 1997 Martin had met then <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics'>Classics</a> student Tim Rice-Oxley.
            During a weekend at <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Water'>Virginia Water</a> in Surrey they
            asked
            each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be
            Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after,
            this
            event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as
            quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the <i>Safety EP.</i> Most of the discs were given to
            record
            companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay
            signed
            to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track <i>Brothers and Sisters
                EP</i>,
            which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.</p>
        <p>After completing their final examinations Coldplay signed a five-album contract with <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlophone'>Parlophone</a> in early 1999. After making their first
            appearance at Glastonbury the band went into the studio to record a third EP, titled <i>The Blue Room</i>.
            Five
            thousand copies were made available to the public in October and the single "Bigger Stronger" received <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1'>BBC Radio 1</a> airplay. The recording sessions for <i>The
                Blue Room</i> were tumultuous. Champion was briefly fired from the band, but Martin later pleaded with
            him
            to return after kicking him out, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band
            worked
            out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands like
            <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/U2'>U2</a> and R.E.M., Coldplay decided that they would operate as a
            democracy. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs.</p>

        <h3>2004&#8211;06: <i>X&amp;Y</i></h3>
        <p>Coldplay spent most of 2004 out of the spotlight, taking a break from touring and releasing a satire music
            video
            of a song from a fictional band titled The Nappies while recording their third album. <i>X&amp;Y</i> was
            released in June 2005 in UK and Europe. This new, delayed release date had put the album back into the next
            fiscal year, actually causing EMI's stock to drop. It became the best-selling album of 2005 with worldwide
            sales
            of 8.3&#160;million. The lead single, "Speed of Sound", made its radio and online music store debut on 18
            April
            and was released as a CD on 23 May 2005. <i>X&amp;Y</i> entered the album charts of 20 countries at the
            number
            one position and was the third-fastest selling album in UK chart history.</p>
        <p>Two other singles were released that year: "Fix You" in September and "Talk" in December. Critical reaction
            to
            <i>X&amp;Y</i> was mostly positive, though slightly less enthusiastic than that of its predecessor. <i>The
                New
                York Times</i> critic Jon Pareles described Coldplay as "the most insufferable band of the decade",
            whereas
            <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/NME'>NME</a> awarded the album 9/10 calling it "Confident, bold,
            ambitious,
            bunged with singles and impossible to contain, 'X&amp;Y' doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does reinforce
            Coldplay as the band of their time". Comparisons between Coldplay and U2 became increasingly common. Chris
            Martin later revealed that the reviews that ranged from mixed to negative, note-worthy for their remarks on
            comparing them to U2, made him feel "liberated".</p>
        <p>From June 2005 to July 2006, Coldplay went on their <i>Twisted Logic Tour</i>, which included festival dates
            like
            Coachella, Isle of Wight Festival, Glastonbury and the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Limits'>Austin
                City Limits</a> Music Festival. In July 2005, the band appeared at <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_8'>Live 8</a> in Hyde Park, where they played a rendition of
            The
            Verve's "Bitter Sweet Symphony" with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ashcroft'>Richard
                Ashcroft</a>
            on vocals. On 28 August, Coldplay performed "Speed of Sound" at the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_MTV_Video_Music_Awards'>2005 MTV Video Music Awards</a> in
            Miami.
            In September, Coldplay recorded a new version of "How You See the World" with reworked lyrics for War
            Child's
            <i>Help!: A Day in the Life</i> charity album. In February 2006, Coldplay earned Best Album and Best Single
            honours at the Brit Awards. Two more singles were released during 2006, "The Hardest Part" and "What If".

        <h3>2006&#8211;09: <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i></h3>
        <p>In October 2006, Coldplay began work on their fourth studio album, <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His
            Friends</i>, with producer Brian Eno. Taking a break from recording, the band toured Latin America in early
            2007, performing in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. After recording in churches and other venues in
            Latin
            America and Spain during their tour, the band said the album would likely reflect <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic'>Hispanic</a> influence. The group spent the rest of the
            year
            recording with Eno.</p>

        <p>Martin described <i>Viva la Vida</i> as a new direction for Coldplay: a change from their past three albums,
            which they have referred to as a "trilogy". He said the album featured less falsetto as he allowed his
            voice's
            lower register to take precedence. Some songs, such as "Violet Hill", contain distorted guitar riffs and
            bluesy
            undertones.</p>
        <p>"Violet Hill" was confirmed as the first single, with a radio release date of 29 April 2008. After the first
            play, it was freely obtainable from Coldplay's website from 12:15&#160;pm&#160;(GMT&#160;+0) for one week
            (achieving two million downloads), until it became commercially available to download on 6 May. "Violet
            Hill"
            entered the UK Top 10, US Top 40 (entering the Top 10 in the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart) and charted well
            in
            the rest of the world. The title track, "Viva la Vida", was also released exclusively on iTunes. It became
            the
            band's first number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and their first UK number one, based on download
            sales
            alone. This was also the first Number One in the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart'>UK
                Singles
                Chart</a> to be based solely on download sales.</p>

        <p>Upon release, <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i> topped the album charts worldwide, and was the
            world's best-selling album of 2008. It hit number one on the UK album chart, despite having come on the
            market
            only three days previously. In that time, it sold 302,000 copies; the BBC called it "one of the
            fastest-selling
            records in UK history". By the end of June, it had set a new record for most-downloaded album ever. In
            October
            2008, Coldplay won two <i>Q</i> Awards for Best Album for <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i>
            and
            Best Act in the World Today. On 9 November, Coldplay were named the World's Best Selling Act of 2008 at the
            <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Music_Awards'>World Music Awards</a> in Monte Carlo. They also
            picked up two other awards, World's Best Selling Rock Act and Great Britain's Best Selling Act. The band
            followed up <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i> with the <i>Prospekt's March EP</i>, which was
            released on 21 November 2008. The EP features tracks from the <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His
                Friends</i>
            sessions and, as well as being available on its own, was issued as a bonus disc with later editions of <i>Viva
                la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i>. "Life in Technicolor II" was the only single released from the
            EP.
        </p>

        <p>Coldplay began their <i>Viva la Vida Tour</i> in June, with a free concert at Brixton Academy in London. This
            was
            followed two days later by a 45-minute performance that was broadcast live from outside BBC Television
            Centre.
            Released in late 2008, "Lost!" became the third single from the album, featuring a new version with Jay-Z.
            After
            performing the opening set on 14 March 2009 for <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Relief'>Sound
                Relief</a> at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Coldplay headlined a sold-out concert later that same night.
            Sound
            Relief is a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland Floods. On 4
            December 2008, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani'>Joe Satriani</a> filed a copyright
            infringement
            suit against Coldplay in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Satriani's
            suit asserted that the Coldplay song "Viva la Vida" includes "substantial original portions" of the Satriani
            song "If I Could Fly" from his 2004 album, <i>Is There Love in Space?</i>. The Coldplay song in question
            received two Grammy Awards for "Song of the Year." The band denied the allegation. An unspecified settlement
            was
            ultimately reached between the parties.</p>
        <p>Coldplay were nominated for four awards at the 2009 Brit Awards: British Group, British Live Act, British
            Single
            ("Viva la Vida") and British Album (<i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i>). At the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/51st_Grammy_Awards'>51st Grammy Awards</a> in the same year,
            Coldplay
            won three Grammy Awards in the categories for Song of Year for "Viva la Vida", Best Rock Album for <i>Viva
                la
                Vida or Death and All His Friends</i>, and Best Vocal Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for "Viva la
            Vida".
            A live album entitled <i>LeftRightLeftRightLeft</i> was recorded at various shows during the tour. <i>LeftRightLeftRightLeft</i>,
            released on 15 May 2009, was to be given away at the remaining concerts of their <i>Viva la Vida</i> tour.
            It
            was also released as a free download from their website. Following the <i>Viva la Vida Tour</i>, Coldplay
            announced another "Latin America Tour" to take place in February and March 2010, in which they were to visit
            Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. In October 2009, Coldplay won Song of the Year for "Viva la Vida"
            at
            The <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Composers,_Authors_and_Publishers'>American
                Society
                of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) Awards in London. In December 2009, <i>Rolling

        <h2>Musical style</h2>
        <p>Martin once proclaimed the band's music as "limestone rock" in comparison to "hard rock". The band's music
            has
            been called "meditative" and "blue romantic"; it "[reflects] on their emotions" and Martin "endlessly
            examine[s]
            his feelings".</p>
        <p>Coldplay started out as one of many earnest post-Britpop bands. In the late 1990s, the EPs released by the
            band
            had characteristics of dream pop, setting them apart from later studio albums. The tone of the band's first
            studio album, <i>Parachutes</i>, was described as melodic pop with "distorted guitar riffs and swishing
            percussion" but also being "exquisitely dark and artistically abrasive". Such alternative rock style has
            been
            compared to bands like U2, Oasis, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead'>Radiohead</a> and Travis.
            The
            band acknowledges the Scottish alternative rock band, Travis, as a major influence on their earlier
            material.
        </p>
        <p>In their second studio album <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>, the band drew inspiration from artists like
            Echo
            &amp; the Bunnymen, Kate Bush, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison'>George Harrison</a> and
            Muse.
            The songs in it were considered to contain "lush melodies and a heartbreak" and that they had a "newfound
            confidence." The music on their third release <i>X&amp;Y</i> has been considered to be "ruminations on
            Martin's
            doubts, fears, hopes, and loves." It was particularly influenced by the artists <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Cash'>Johnny Cash</a> and Kraftwerk.</p>
        <p>In <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i>, the group's style was moving towards art rock, being
            influenced by the bands Blur, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_Fire'>Arcade Fire</a> and My Bloody
            Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and
            further
            so. <i>Mylo Xyloto</i> carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced <i>Viva la Vida</i>
            and
            expands the spectrum to include electronic and acoustic elements. Lyrical influences were taken from
            graffiti
            and the German resistance group White Rose.</p>
        <p>Regarding the band's wide international success, Parlophone's president Miles Leonard has stated that one of
            their "secrets" is that they have never sounded like a parochial UK artist, saying: "Some bands are very
            proud
            to be British, but sometimes come across as being very &#8216;British&#8217;. Coldplay never aspire to that;
            on
            one hand they sound British but on the other they sound like a huge global artist." In 2011 Coldplay were
            hailed
            as 'rock statesmen'.</p>

        <h2>Activism and commercial endorsements</h2>
        <p>Despite their worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media,
            refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay turned down multi-million dollar contracts
            from
            Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs "Yellow", "Trouble", and "Don't Panic"
            respectively.
            According to frontman, Chris Martin, "We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs'
            meanings
            like that." The song "Viva la Vida" was featured in a commercial for the iTunes Store, advertising its
            exclusive
            availability of the single as a digital download on iTunes. Additionally, Chris Martin appeared at an <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.'>Apple Inc.</a> Special Event on 1 September 2010,
            playing a
            number of songs, and also thanked Apple for their assistance in marketing "Viva la Vida". After the death of
            Steve Jobs, Coldplay performed four songs at Apple's Campus in Cupertino, further thanking Jobs for the
            support
            he gave them.</p>
        <p>Coldplay supports <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International'>Amnesty International</a> and
            performed for them at The Secret Policeman's Ball fundraiser in 2012. Martin is regarded as one of the most
            visible celebrity advocates for fair trade, supporting Oxfam's ongoing Make Trade Fair campaign. He has been
            on
            trips with <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam'>Oxfam</a> to assess conditions, has appeared in its
            advertising campaign, and is known for wearing a "Make Trade Fair" wristband during public appearances
            (including at Coldplay concerts). The band were also filmed for Make Poverty History, clicking their
            fingers.
        </p>
        <p>During the early years, Coldplay became widely known in the media for giving 10 per cent of the band's
            profits to
            charity, which they continue to do. Bassist Guy Berryman said, "You can make people aware of issues. It
            isn't
            very much effort for us at all, but if it can help people, then we want to do it." The band also asks that
            any
            gifts intended for them are donated to charity, according to a response on the FAQ section of Coldplay's
            website. Martin spoke out against the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq'>2003
                invasion of
                Iraq</a> by the US, UK and other forces during the <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Cancer_Trust'>Teenage
                Cancer Trust</a> show at London's Royal Albert Hall on 24 March 2003, where he encouraged the sell-out
            crowd
            to "sing against war". He would later endorse the US Democratic presidential candidates <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry'>John Kerry</a> and <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama'>Barack Obama</a> in 2008 and 2012 respectively.</p>
        <p>In June 2009, Coldplay began supporting Meat Free Monday, a food campaign started by <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney'>Paul McCartney</a> which attempts to help slow climate
            change by having at least one meat free day a week. From 17 and 31 December 2009, Coldplay auctioned a
            quantity
            of significant band memorabilia, including their first guitars. Proceeds went to Kids Company, a charity
            which
            helps vulnerable children and young people in London. A month later in January 2010, Coldplay performed a
            slightly modified version of "A Message", entitled "A Message 2010", at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon
            special,
            raising money for the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.</p>
        <p>In 2011 Coldplay endorsed the song "Freedom for Palestine" by posting a link to the video. In less than a day
            12,000 comments were made on that post. Some threatened to boycott the band, and a Facebook group was
            created
            that demanded an apology to Israel. The link to the song was eventually removed from their Facebook wall.
            According to Frank Barat of OneWorld, the link was not removed by Coldplay, but by Facebook after "thousands
            of
            people (and computer generated posts) reported it as abusive."</p>
        <p>Album Artists (www.albumartists.co.uk) staged an exhibition of art from <i>Mylo Xyloto</i> at Proud Gallery
            in
            Camden to support the charity <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Company'>Kids Company</a> in November&#8212;December
            2012. The exhibition raised over &#163;610,000 for the children's charity which supports disadvantaged
            children
            in London. In November 2014, Martin joined the charity group Band Aid 30, performing alongside current
            British
            and Irish pop acts on the latest version of the track "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise money for the
            2014
            Ebola crisis in Western Africa&#8212;this was the second time Martin has contributed to a Band Aid recording
            having performed in the 2004 version (Band Aid 20).</p>
        <p>In June 2016 the band supported Vote Remain in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.
            Following
            the <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit'>Brexit</a> result which saw 52% of the UK voting to leave the
            EU
            (despite the majority of younger people voting remain), Chris Martin stated: "This decision does not
            represent
            us or indeed most of our generation and the generation following us."</p>
