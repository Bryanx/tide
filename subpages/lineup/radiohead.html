        <p><b>Radiohead</b> are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of <a
                href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke'>Thom Yorke</a> (lead vocals, guitar, piano,
            keyboards), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Greenwood'>Jonny Greenwood</a> (lead guitar,
            keyboards, other instruments), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_O'>Ed O'Brien</a>
            (guitar, backing vocals), <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Greenwood'>Colin Greenwood</a>
            (bass), and <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Selway'>Phil Selway</a> (drums, percussion,
            backing vocals). They have worked with producer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Godrich'>Nigel
                Godrich</a> and cover artist <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Donwood'>Stanley
                Donwood</a> since 1994.</p>
        <p>Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls
            and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in <i>Rolling
                Stone</i>'s list of "The Greatest Artists of All Time"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both
            included in <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list
            of greatest singers. In 2009, <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers voted the group the second-best artist of the
            2000s.</p>
        <h2>Style and songwriting</h2>
        <p>Among Radiohead members' earliest influences were Queen, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd'
        >Pink Floyd</a> and Elvis Costello,
            post-punk acts such as Joy Division, <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Siouxsie_and_the_Banshees'
            >Siouxsie and the Banshees</a> and Magazine, and
            significantly 1980s alternative rock bands such as U2, R.E.M., Pixies, the Smiths and Sonic Youth. By the
            mid-1990s, Radiohead began to adopt some recording methods from hip hop, inspired by the sampling work of DJ
            Shadow, and became interested in using computers to generate sounds. Other influences on the group include
            the jazz music of Miles Davis, Charlie Mingus and Alice Coltrane, the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, 1960s
            rock groups such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, and Phil Spector's "wall of sound" production technique.
        </p>
        <p>The electronic music of <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> was inspired by Yorke's admiration for glitch,
            ambient techno and IDM as exemplified by <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_Records'>Warp
                Records</a> artists such as <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Autechre'>Autechre</a> and Aphex
            Twin; in 2013, Yorke named <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin'>Aphex Twin</a> as
            biggest influence. The album also samples early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Coltrane'>Alice Coltrane</a> and Miles Davis, and
            1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny
            Greenwood's interest in <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_classical_music'>20th
                century classical music</a> also had a role, as the influence of composers <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Penderecki'>Krzysztof Penderecki</a> and <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Messiaen'>Olivier Messiaen</a> was apparent; for
            several songs on <i>Kid A</i> and later albums, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic
            instrument popularised by Messiaen.</p>
        <p>Recording <i>In Rainbows</i>, Radiohead members mentioned a variety of rock, electronic, hip hop and
            experimental musicians as influences, including Bj&#246;rk, M.I.A, Liars, <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeselektor'>Modeselektor</a> and Spank Rock. In 2011,
            Yorke denied that Radiohead had ever set out deliberately to change musical styles or to make "experimental
            music", saying the band was "constantly absorbing music" and that a variety of musicians are always
            influencing their work. Drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said
            that Radiohead did not see themselves as a rock band and felt their methodology had closer parallels with
            jazz: &#8220;they deliberately try to avoid clich&#233; and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock
            bands don&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s far more like a jazz mentality."</p>
        <p>Since their formation, Radiohead have been lyrically and musically spearheaded by Yorke. Although Yorke is
            responsible for writing nearly all the lyrics, songwriting is a collaborative effort, with all the band
            members having roles in the process; all the band's songs are officially credited to "Radiohead". Radiohead
            songs usually begin with a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the
            other members develop their own parts. The <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> sessions brought about a change
            in Radiohead's musical style and working method. Since their shift from conventional rock music
            instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now
            regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On <i>Kid A</i> and
            <i>Amnesiac</i>, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot rather
            than guitar, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum
            machines and digital manipulations, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and
            percussion, respectively, into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for <i>Hail to the
                Thief</i> led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that his power in
            the band had been "absolutely unbalanced" and that he would "subvert everybody else's power at all costs.
            But&#160;... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy-wise, than it used to be."</p>
        <h2>Collaborators</h2>

        <p>Radiohead have maintained a close relationship with a number of frequent collaborators. Producer Nigel
            Godrich made his name with Radiohead, working with the band as an audio engineer on <i>The Bends</i> and as
            their producer on every studio album afterwards. He has been dubbed the "sixth member" of the band, in an
            allusion to <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin'>George Martin</a> being called the
            "Fifth Beatle". In 2016, Godrich said of the collaboration: "I can only ever have one band like Radiohead
            who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. <a
                    href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles'>The Beatles</a> could only have ever had one
            George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and
            knowledge of each other would have been thrown out of the window and they'd have to start again."</p>
        <p>Graphic artist Stanley Donwood met Yorke when both were art students, and with Yorke has produced all of
            Radiohead's album covers and visual artwork since 1994. Donwood works in the studio with the band as they
            record, allowing the music to influence the artwork. He and Yorke won a Grammy in 2002 for the special
            edition of <i>Amnesiac</i> packaged as a library book.</p>
        <p>Dilly Gent has been responsible for commissioning all Radiohead music videos since <i>OK Computer</i>,
            working with the band to find a director suitable for each project. Since Radiohead's inception, Andi Watson
            has been their lighting and stage director, designing the visuals of live concerts, such as the
            carbon-neutral "LED forest" of the <i>In Rainbows</i> tour. Radiohead's chief live technician, Peter "Plank"
            Clements, has worked with the band since before <i>The Bends</i>, overseeing the setup of their instruments
            for studio recordings and live performances. Drummer <a href='http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Deamer'
            >Clive Deamer</a> has performed and
            recorded with Radiohead since 2011.</p>
