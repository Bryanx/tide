    <h2>Before you go, here are some things you might want to know...</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>How to get there...</h3>
        <h4>You can also ask us a question on our <a href="http://facebook.com">facebook</a> page.</h4>
        <p>The best way to get to Tide is by bike or public transport. The NMBS Hasselt Station is the public
            transport hub. Tide can be reached by train via Hasselt Station or Kiewit Station. Kiewit Station (one
            stop after Hasselt Station) is within walking distance of the festival site (only 500 m).</p>

        <p>From 6 am on Wednesday 17th August till 4 pm on Sunday 21st August, the Kempische Steenweg will be closed to
            all motorised traffic around the Tide site. The stretch of road between the junctions
            Vijversstraat/Tulpinstraat and Europalaan/Walenstraat will only be accessible to cyclists, festivalgoers and
            local residents. This is the section from Kiewit train station to the church; the festival site and Camping
            Chill are situated in between. A regular fast bus service (shuttles) has been arranged between Hasselt
            station and the Tide festival site, operated by De Lijn. A Tide e-train ticket allows you free travel from
            any station in Belgium to Hasselt station or Kiewit station – and includes the return trip too. The special
            bus service between Hasselt station and the festival site is also included in your festival ticket.</p>

        <h3>Where is what?</h3>
        <p>Swimming in the Tide lake is one of the best things you can do during the hot
            Tide days! Forgot your bikini? Strip off and dive in! Swimming naked, or skinny
            dipping, is allowed and encouraged!
            But be careful, there can be strong currents in the lake, do not swim out too
            far! And be mindful: do not piss or shit in the lake! Use the compost toilets and
            contribute to producing soil for a more fertile Earth!
            Note: The lake water quality is monitored on a daily basis by legal institutions, but it
            is not drinking water! NO PISS, NO SHIT & NO SOAP/SHAMPOO IN THE LAKE.</p>

        <p>In the Central Plaza you can find the Tide’s Info
            stand, where a friendly staff is ready to answer
            ALL your questions on the program, location of
            services… Here you can also find a Lost and Found box, where to bring other
            people’s belongings you might have found on
            the ground or where to look for something you
            have lost (more info on the lost and found? Is
            there an email to write to after Tide?). </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Some rules you really have to follow</h3>
        <p> 1. Please do not bring your cat, dog, rabbit, hamster or goat to Tide. Several
            Tideers were injured by dogs that were abandoned by their owners - people
            that mistreat pets are not welcome at Tide.
            Besides being a very loud place, highly unsuitable for pets, the Tide site is abundant
            of leishmaniasis, a disease that can kill animals! We’ve had very tragic events in the
            past and we hope you’ll understand (and your pets too).
            Note: in Caravan Park B, it is allowed to keep dogs, but always on a leash or
            inside the caravan, to avoid dog fights.
            2. Reduce disposable non-biodegradable products in your bag. DONT PUT ANYTHING BUT HUMAN WASTE INSIDE THE
            COMPOST TOILETS.
            Put wet wipes, baby diapers…and the like in the provided containers. Leave the Tide Land clean and more
            beautiful than you found it! Don’t leave your
            rubbish behind, but only in the designated areas.
            Note: If you can’t carry your tent, shade or any other structure back home, pack
            it down and bring it to the Info Stand, so that it can be reused.
            3.DRINK PLENTY OF WATER. Don’t fall asleep in the sun. You could burn your skin and become dangerously
            dehydrated. Keep skin clean and protected from the sun, by wiping the dust and hydrating
            with sun lotion and lip balm (especially for those with a skin condition). Alternative
            remedies for sun protection include Belladonna 30c, a homeopathic remedy that
            can help with dry, red-hot, throbbing skin or sunstroke. Use Sunscreen (min. SPF 50)!
            3. Respect the locals. Life outside of Tide moves at a slow pace. The local population is elderly and
            many of them speak Portuguese only. Please be mindful and respectful of the
            locals when you are travelling in the area. Having a good relationship with the
            locals is fundamental for the continuation of the festival!

        <h3>Accesability for people with a disability</h3>
        <p> Tide is everybody’s home and for this reason
            everybody is welcome, including, and even
            more, those with special needs.
            To guarantee people with special needs (with or
            without helpers) a Tide experience that is as
            close as possible to that of any other Tideer,
            the Tide provides: Special camping area next to showers
            and toilets, private toilets next to some of the main areas
            (ask for keys at the main bar), private parking to facilitate access, one person 24h at the Info Stand to
            take care of any possible issue related to special needs.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Food, drinks and more on the festival</h3>
        <p> For all food types there are plenty of options at Tide: from raw and veggie to Asian, Middle
            Eastern, Mediterranean… you name it! It is mandatory for restaurants to have affordable
            prices. Conscious food stalls are predominant at Tide. We ask restaurants to opt for local,
            organic ingredients and it is mandatory to use bio-degradable dishes and cutlery.
            We have two supermarkets where you can buy fresh food and cold drinks.
